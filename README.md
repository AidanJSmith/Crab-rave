# Crab-rave
RAVE ON!

## How do you use it?
In order to send approximately 176 requests/second, better optimized on hardware with more threads, simply go to the form you'd like to blast with the rave, and capture network traffic. From there, submit, and curl the API call found in the developer's console. Replace the curl command seen here with that, and watch the world burn. (In linux, solely)

### What does it need?
As mentioned earlier, it's a shell script, so if you're not running this on a linux based operating system.... What are you doing? You don't deserve the rave.
